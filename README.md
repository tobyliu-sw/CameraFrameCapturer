### Features

- Support switching front and back camera
- Support changing captured video frames quality
- Support changing device orientation

### Notes

- Because UI components could be only updated in main thread, please use DispatchQueue.main.async {} to update UI in the delegate function.
```
    func didCaptured(image: UIImage) {
        // UIImageView can only be updated in main thread
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.imageView.image = image
        }
    }
```
